# CTS Audit
Project Overview
This project is a Spring Boot-based web application that demonstrates an Audit Log system. It uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture and an H2 database for data storage.

MVC Architecture: The project follows the MVC architectural pattern to separate concerns and improve code organization.

Audit Log Functionality: The core functionality of the project is to capture and store audit logs for data changes in the application. (Under dev, need to find a way to obtain IP and other stuffs to "POST" it)

H2 Database: It utilizes an H2 in-memory database for simplicity, but might replace it with another database like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

User Authentication (Planned in future maybe, idk): If needed, you can implement user authentication to associate audit logs with specific users.
